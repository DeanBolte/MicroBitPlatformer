# MicroBitPlatformer
A small game made for the Micro:bit, a simple one input, auto-scrolling platformer. this was a small project made for a university subject, it is being expanded upon here.

a complete redesign is needed for the base of the code, as such i will be beginning again with a revamped platforming engine for a new project with a larger range of player inputs.
